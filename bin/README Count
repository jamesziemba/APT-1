Started and completed this APT on Jan. 11. It took me about 30 minutes.
I did not consult anybody.
I consulted Stack Overflow regarding java syntax surrounding converting an int to a string and the charAt
method for strings. I also consulted the Java and Python equivalents sheet on Sakai to learn how to properly
code if/else statements and for loops.
I thought this was good practice to hone our java skills and learn methods that we might not in a regular
class setting.

Started and completed this APT on Jan. 12. It took me about 20 minutes.
I did not consult anybody.
I consulted Stack Overflow regarding java syntax surrounding the .length method to find the length of an array
and indexing an array. I also consulted the Java and Python equivalents sheet on Sakai to learn how to properly
code if and else statements and for loops.
I thought this was good practice to hone our java skills.

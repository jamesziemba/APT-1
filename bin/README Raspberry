Started and completed this APT on Jan. 13. It took me about 30 minutes.
I did not consult anybody.
I also consulted the Java and Python equivalents sheet on Sakai to learn how to properly code while loops.
I thought this was good practice to hone our java skills and write a while loop, which I usually have trouble
with.

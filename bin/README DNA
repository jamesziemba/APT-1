Started and completed this APT on Jan. 12. It took me about 20 minutes.
I did not consult anybody.
I consulted Stack Overflow regarding java syntax surrounding the .length() method to find the length of an int
and how to use charAt for strings.I also consulted the Java and Python equivalents sheet on Sakai to learn how
to properly code for loops.
I thought this was good practice to hone our java skills.
